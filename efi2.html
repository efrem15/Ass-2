    <h1>#2:Busness advertisment</h1>
      <P>  Many websites give you marketing examples that are the prettiest, most creative, etc. Today I present the 
           most successful 50 magazine ads of all time. What I mean by successful, is return on investment. So if you
           want to create a successful ad you should use the following ads as a template.Are these ads creative? Yes,
           but not at the expense of providing enough information so that the client can 
           make an informed decision on whether to buy. Each ad contains a powerful headline, normally one eye attracting
           image and more text than youâ€™ll see in many unsuccessful ads of today.</P>
       <p> 
            Not only were these ads creative, they were truly revolutionary. And the consumer 
            rewarded them for their hard work, with tons of cash. By the way, these magazine 
            ads would provide you with a great template for a flyer, poster, sign or bulletin 
            board.Enjoy and if you have any questions leave them in the comment section below.
